# VENNTURING INTO FILM INDUSTRY 

<img src="" />

## Project OverviewÂ¶
The goal of this project is to generate insights that will guide the business stakeholders, specifically the head of our new movie studio company in determining which films to create for viewers. We shall use exploratory data analysis(EDA) on our movie-related datasets and analyze trends in the data in order to provide actionable insights and recommendations to ensure success in our new company.


## Business Understanding
Our company is venturing into the film industry by creating a new movie studio and needs to make informed decisions on the types of films to produce. This is based on which types of films perform best at the box office. Some of the key business questions to ask include:

* Which movie genre averages the highest gross revenue? ,
* Which studios are linked to generating the highest gross revenue and more

## Data Understanding
For this project, we shall be working with data from multiple sources including a relational database `IM.DB` with tables `movie basics` and `movie ratings` being our key focus and a csv file containing data on revenue generated from various box office movies `bom.movie_gross.csv`. Merging these datasets is crucial so as to get comprehensive meaningful conclusions and recommendations.

## Data Analysis/Cleaning
Cleaning our data is effective in getting good analysis for our visualizations. We shall use various functions during data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, mixed data types etc.
On carrying out data analysis, we shall be creating visualizations in order to gather insights and find befitting recommendations for our new studio company.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
_*Summary*_
1. **Genre Performance According to Average Domestic and Foreign Revenue.**
Investing on high performing genres:
Based on the analysis we have made, by both average domestic and foreign revenue generation, sci-fi films is the genre ranked as the highest average gross revenue creator. Action, Adventure and Family movies have also been consistently showing high average gross revenues both locally and internationally. Therefore, when focussing on producing films, I would recommend making more films related to such genres.

2.  **Studio Performance.**
Strategic partnerships:
Collaborating with studios that are recorded to produce high-grossing movies such as BV, Universal, Fox and  Warner Bros movie studios can lead to yielding good returns. Learning from their expertise by adopting their practices can be very beneficial to our new movie studio.

3. **Trend of Average Annual Gross Revenue over the years.**
Between 2010 and 2018, there has been a relative surge in the average amount of gross revenue been created by films. This means that the movie production industry is been considered quite a valuable investment as of now and by diving into this industry at this moment, there might just be a likelihood of success in our business(considering the above recommendations too).
